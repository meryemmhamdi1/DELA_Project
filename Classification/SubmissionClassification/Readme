To generate the data with extracted features, you can go to TableFeatureCreation folder and run the scripts CreateTable.py to generate training dataset with features (OutputTableTrain.csv) and CreateTableTestDataset.py to generate testing dataset with features (OutputTableTest.csv). All versions of the data are kept in folder RawAndFeatureData. Here we include also, TrainAllFeatures.csv and TestAllFeatures.csv which has main features used in the classifiers in addition to other features that were generated and tried but didn't give better results (the details of the extraction of those features are in folder Notebooks in jupyter ipython notebook called CleanStart.ipynb). In folder Notebooks, you can also find other code (other training classifiers including majority voting,...) tried in python. Folder R contains all classifiers code in R each in a separate file. Please make sure to change directory for data input (for example in line 9 in ClassificationNormalizedAggregatedFeaturesRF.R) and for data output (for example lines 108, 137, 139 in the same file)
